The GDM License (“License”) governs the use of the software (“Software”) and is granted by Giovane de Morais (“Author”) to any individual or entity (“Licensee”) who wishes to use, modify, or distribute the Software, subject to the following terms and conditions:

1. Maintenance of Open Source
1.1. Open Source Requirement
The Software must remain open source in all its forms and versions. Any modification, adaptation, or derivative of the Software must also be licensed under this same License.

1.2. Relevant Modification
A “relevant modification” is defined as any and all changes to the Software, regardless of size or scope, except for trivial formatting corrections. Any modification that affects functionality, performance, or security shall be considered relevant.

1.3. Publication of Modifications
All modifications or derivatives must be published in a publicly accessible repository authorized by the Author and the community, no later than fifteen (15) days after the modification is completed or put into production.

1.4. Auditing System
An auditing system may be implemented to verify compliance with these open-source requirements. The Author reserves the right to audit repositories where the Software is maintained or used.

2. Commercial Use and Royalties
2.1. Commercial Use
Commercial use of the Software is permitted only upon obtaining a commercial license directly from the Author. Any commercial use without a formal contract constitutes a violation of this License.

2.2. License Agreement
The Licensee must contact the Author to negotiate the terms of a commercial licensing agreement. Failure to establish a formal contract prior to engaging in commercial activities is a breach of this License.

2.3. Definition of Commercial Use
Commercial use includes, but is not limited to, any utilization that yields direct or indirect financial benefit (e.g., integration into paid products, corporate settings aimed at profit, or revenue-generating distributions).

2.4. Audits
The Author reserves the right to conduct periodic audits, with prior notice, to verify compliance with commercial licensing terms. Refusal to cooperate may result in immediate License revocation and further legal action.

The Author must be credited as the original creator of the Software in any form of use, distribution, presentation, or documentation of the Software.

3.2. Visibility of Attribution
The attribution must be clearly displayed in:

 - The header of the source code

 - Any user interface where the Software is utilized (e.g., splash screens, “About” dialogs)

3.3. Attribution Details
The attribution must include the Author’s name (“Giovane de Morais”), the creation year (2025), and a link (if applicable) to the official repository or relevant project page.

4. License Compatibility
4.1. Explicit Compatibility
This License permits integration with projects licensed under GPL, Apache 2.0, and MIT only. Any integration with other licenses requires the Author’s prior written consent.

4.2. Conflict of Terms
In the event of a conflict between this License and any other license, the terms of this License shall prevail.

4.3. Preservation of Requirements
Integration with permitted licenses must preserve the open-source and attribution requirements herein.

5. Patents
5.1. Author’s Patent Rights
The Author reserves the right to patent the Software or any innovations contained therein.

This License grants permission to use any patents associated with the Software exclusively within the context of this License. Any partial or complete extraction of such patented technology for use outside this License is strictly prohibited without the Author’s explicit consent.

5.3. Proprietary Projects
Usage of any portion of the Software in proprietary or otherwise non-compliant projects requires a separate patent license from the Author.

6. Limitation of Liability
6.1. As-Is Basis
The Software is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

6.2. Scope of Liability
This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction specified in this License. If any portion of this clause is deemed invalid in a particular jurisdiction, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.

6.3. Disclaimer of Damages
In no event shall the Author be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

7. Termination and Revocation
7.1. Automatic Revocation
Failure to comply with any term of this License results in the automatic revocation of the Licensee’s rights.

7.2. Notice and Cure Period
The Licensee shall receive a formal notice detailing the violation and be granted thirty (30) days to appeal or correct it, starting from the date the notice is sent to the Licensee’s registered contact.

7.3. Post-Revocation
In the event of revocation, the Licensee must immediately cease using the Software and remove all copies or dependencies. Revocation does not exempt the Licensee from liability for any past breach.

8. License Amendments
8.1. Right to Update
The Author reserves the right to amend or update this License at any time. Such amendments are not retroactive.

8.2. Future Releases
Amended versions shall be published in the Software’s official repository and apply exclusively to future releases. Previous releases remain governed by the License in effect at the time of their release.

8.3. Acceptance of New Terms
Continuing to use or distribute future versions of the Software after new terms are published constitutes acceptance of the updated License. If the Licensee does not agree with the updated License, they must cease using future releases.

9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

Distribution of the Software is only valid if carried out through repositories authorized by the Author. Any distribution outside authorized repositories must receive explicit written approval from the Author.

10.2. Commercial Registration
For commercial usage, the Licensee must register with the Author’s authentication system and obtain a valid license key or certificate. Any commercial deployment without such registration is a violation of this License.
